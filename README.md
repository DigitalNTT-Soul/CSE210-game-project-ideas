# Ideas for CSE 210 Game project
---
* Idea 1: Maybe some sort of card game, using W03's custom Deck/Card classes?
    * Definitely make a custom deck of cards with fancy effects
    * Perhaps the cards can somehow serve as the weapons used in Idea 2?

* Idea 2: Side-scroller action-y platformer with time travel?
    * "Hold (button) to rewind
    * Time travel achieved via holding most-recent 5 second (or X frames, similar to 5 seconds) of game-state variables in an array and applying them to current game-state in backwards order.
